finegan wake was designed to be the  night book to that day book so it was  conceived of as a dream and one of the  questions that  undergraduates are ask to share Dan over  is whose dream is  it Joyce uh once in a famous interview  said that uh if the whole  universe were to be destroyed  and only finan wake survive that the  goal had been that then the entire  universe could be  reconstructed out of this some of you  who are students of Torah this is a very  talmudic idea that somehow a book is the  primary reality you know the idea in  hassidism in some schools is that all of  the future is already  contained in in in in the Torah and then  when you ask them well if it's contained  there then isn't it  predestined and the answer is no because  the letters are scrambled and only the  movement of the present moment through  the text correctly unscrambles and  arranges the letter this is Joyce  thinking for sure and it's it's very  close to a central theme in Joyce and a  central theme in the western religious  tradition which is the coming into being  the manifestation of the word the  declension of the word into  matter hey everyone it's denit  Friedman here's another Terren talk for  you hope you will enjoy  it finigan wake is the  is the uh last and most ambitious and  most puzzling work of uh the British  writer James Joyce who of course wrote  Dubliners and ulses and if ulses is the  algebra of literature then finnan's wake  is the partial differential  equation uh most of us break down at  algebra few of us aspire to go on to the  partial linear differential  equation  um in some ways I think it can arguably  said that this is the quintessential  work of art or at least work of  literature of the 20th century and Joyce  intended it that way uh Joseph Campbell  called it a staggering allegory of the  Fallen Redemption of mankind equally  respected critics have called it a  surrender to the crossword puzzle  portion of the human  mind so uh the main thing about it is  that it is  linguistically dense it is dense on  every level it has over  63,000 individual words in it that's  long more words than most fictional  manuscripts have words period it has  over 5,000  characters in it uh  ulses was designed as a kind of Joyce  thought of it as his day book uh it  follows the paginations of an ordinary  Dubliner this is Ulisses an ordinary  Dubliner through the vicissitudes of his  day his struggles to buy some kidneys to  fry for breakfast his chance meeting  with his wife's lover so forth and so on  uh  uh fairly straightforward exposition of  the techniques of literature that have  been perfected in the 20th century  stream of  Consciousness uh so forth and so on  Slice of Life Finnegan's wake was  designed to be the night book to that  day book so it was conceived of as a  dream and one of the questions that  undergraduate are asked to shed ink over  is whose dream is it and and what is  this book about I mean when you first  pick it up it's absolutely daunting  there doesn't seem to be a way into it  it seems to be barely in English and the  notion you know that one could by  spending time with this tease out  characters plot literary tension  resolution this sort of thing seems  fairly  unlikely actually it it's one of the few  things that really  repays pouring effort into it the first  25 pages are incredibly dense and most  people are eliminated somewhere in those  first 25 pages and so you never really  it's a language and you have to gain a  facility with it and you have to cheat  that's the other thing and there's lots  of help cheating because it has spawned  a great exotical literature all kinds of  pale Scholars eager to give you the  Celtic word lists of finnan's wake or a  discussion of uh the doctrine of the  transubstantiation in Fan's wake or so  forth and so on hundreds of these kinds  of doctrinal thesis in in compit have  been ground out over the  decades the reason I'm interested in it  uh I suppose I should fess up is because  it's two things clearly uh finan wake is  psychedelic and it is apocalyptic SL  eschatological and what I mean by those  phrases is first of all what I mean by  psychedelic is there is no uh stable  point of view there is no character per  se you you never know who is speaking  you have to read into each speech to  discover you know is this King mark an  Olivia plabel Humphrey chimp near wicker  Shem the Penman sha who is it uh and  identities are not fixed those of you  who have followed my rap over the years  I'm always raving about how psychedelics  dissolve boundaries well uh finnan's  wake is as if you had taken the entirety  of the last thousand years of human  history and dissolved all the boundaries  so Queen mob becomes May West uh you  know uh all the personages of Pop  Culture politics art church history  Irish Legend uh Irish interesing  politics are all swirling changing  merging time is not linear you will find  yourself uh uh at a recent political  rally then return to the court of this  or that  abian uh Emperor or Pharaoh uh it's like  a trip and the great technique I was  thinking about this as I was thinking  about this lecture the great technique  of the 20th century is collage or pasti  it was originally developed by the um by  the Dos in Zurich in  1919 right now it's having a huge  Resurgence in the form of sampling in  pop music and Joyce was the Supreme  sampler I mean he draws his material  from technical cataloges  menus uh legal briefs treaty language  mythologies  dreams doctor patient conversations  everything is gris for this  enormous uh  Distillery and yet you know what comes  out of this once you learn the codes and  once you learn to play the game is a a a  joyan story that all graduates of ulses  will recognize I mean the main what  Joyce was about was an incredible  sympathy with common people and an  awareness of the Dilemma of uh you know  being a Jew in Irish Ireland  being a devote of scholasticism in the  20th century be of dislocation and  disorientation of being the cuckolded  husband of being the failed Divinity  student all of these characters and  themes are uh familiar it it's quite an  uh it's quite an amazing accomplishment  there's nothing else like it in in  literature it had very  little um anticip  ipation the only real anticipator of joy  in English I think is Thomas Nash who  most people have never heard of Thomas  Nash was a contemporary of Shakespeare  and and wrote a famous I don't know what  that means in such a context but a novel  called uh uh the the  uh he was called the wayfaring  traveler anyway Nash had this  megalomanic richness of language this  attitude that it's better to put it in  than take it out and and that's  certainly what you get with Joyce I mean  Joyce is so dense with technical terms  brand names uh pop  references uh  localisms uh his the way to conceive a  finan wake really is like a a mid a  garbage dump and there is in fact a  garbage dump in the Wake that feel that  figures very prominently and what you as  the reader have to do is go in there  with nutp pick and toothbrush and  essentially remove one level after  another level after another level and  sink down and down and the theme is  always the same you know the delivery of  the word the misinterpretation of the  word and the Redemption  of the word at every level in all times  and places um the reason I'm now gone  some distance toward explaining why I  think of it as psychedelic the reason  why I think of it as eschatological and  apocalyptic is because he  really the entire universe could be  reconstructed out of this some of you  who are students of Torah this is a very  talmood  idea that somehow a book is the  primary reality you know the idea  hassidism in some schools is that all of  the future is already  contained in in in in the Torah and then  when you ask them well if it's contained  there then isn't it  predestined and the answer is no because  the letters are scram LED and only the  movement of the present moment through  the text correctly unscrambles and  arranges the letter this is Joyce  thinking for sure and it's it's very  close to a central theme in Joyce and a  central theme in the western religious  tradition which is the coming into being  the manifestation of the word the  declension of the word in into matter  and uh uh in a sense what Joyce was  trying to do was he was in that great  tradition of literary alchemy that whose  earlier practitioners were people like U  Robert flood athanasius  kerser uh  paracelis these are not familiar names  but in the late flowering of alchemy  when the birth of modern science  could already The Rosy Glow could  already be seen The Alchemist turned  toward  literary allegory in the 16th and early  17th century Joy is essentially in that  tradition I mean this is an effort to  condense the entire of experience all  all as J as Joyce says in the Wake all  uh uh all SpaceTime in a not shall is  what we're searching for here uh a kind  of uh philosopher stone of literary  associations from which the entire  universe can be made uh to Blossom forth  and the way it's done is through  pun and tricks of language and uh double  and triple and quadruple on Tandra uh no  word is opaque every word is transparent  and you see through it to older meanings  stranger associations and as your mind  tries to follow these um  associative trees of connection you  eventually you you get the feeling which  is the unique feeling that the Wake  gives you which is it's about as close  to LSD on the page as uh you can get  because you are simultaneously many  points of view simultaneously many  uh um dramatis Losi many places in the  plot and the whole thing is riddled with  resonance uh you know a man uh doing a  task on one level is on another level a  Greek god completing a task and on  another level uh uh some other figure of  some more obscure mythology so really  one thing about fining and wake it's  like a dipstick for your own  intelligence what you bring to it is  going to determine what you get out and  if you have  read the books which Joyce was familiar  with or if you have armed yourself with  such simple things as a pH your's guide  to Ireland or a good map of Ireland or a  good work of Irish mythology then uh it  immediately begins to betray its secrets  to you and it's so rich that it's easy  to make original discoveries it's easy  to see and understand things which  probably have not been seen or  understood since James Joyce uh put it  there because he he had this kind of all  inclusive uh intelligence maybe I didn't  make clear enough why that to my mind is  an  eschatological phenomena this production  of the philosopher stone it's because  all it's about the union of spirit and  matter that's what the philosopher stone  is about and writing a book which  aspires to be the seed for a living  world is about the union of spirit and  matter as well and the the um the  Christian scenario of uh Redemption at  the end of profane history is another uh  scenario of trans substan and Union  Union of spirit and matter this seems to  be in fact the overarching theme of  finans wake and of uh of the 20th  century in terms of the temporal context  for this book uh it was finished in  193 uh 9 a few months before 1939 and  Joyce died early in 39 in a sense he  died in one of the most science fiction  moments of the 20th century because the  Third Reich was going strong it had not  yet been pegged down a notch uh schemes  of eugenics and thousand year uh  racially purified  super  civilizations all of that crazy early  40s uh uh stuff was happening and the  book is  surprisingly modern uh television  appears psychedelic drugs appear all of  these things appear he mean preent he  was some kind of a prophet and also he  understood the 20th century sufficiently  that the part he hadn't yet lived  through through was as transparent to  him at the part as the part that he had  he could see what was  coming  well that's by way of my introduction I  want to read you what some other people  have said about this because um uh I  don't think I can say enough on my own  this is the  indispensable book if you're serious  about this a skeleton key to Finnigan's  Wake and it it it takes the view that we  don't know what this thing is so we have  to go through it literally line by line  and he tells you the story in the entire  story in the onepage version in the 10  page version and in the 200 Page version  and even in the 200 Page version there  are sections where Campbell simply  reports the next five pages are  extremely obscure  Market uh but this is a just a short  section and one of the things about  working with the wake is you become at  first this language which is so  impenetrable and bizarre it ends up  infecting you and you become unable to  write or talk any other way so I'll read  you some of Campbell's introduction and  I think you will see it's like the Wake  itself except in baby  steps introduction to a strange  subject running riddle and fluid answer  Finnegan's wake is a mighty allegory of  the fall and resurrection of mankind it  is a strange book a compound of fable  Symphony and Nightmare a monstrous  Enigma beckoning imperiously from the  shadowy pits of sleep its mechanic  resemble those of a dream a dream which  has freed the author from the  necessities of common logic and has  enabled him to compress all periods of  History All Phases of individual and  racial development into a circular  design of which every part is beginning  middle and end in a gigantic Wheeling  Reus dim Effigies Rumble past disappear  into foggy Horizons and are replaced by  other images vague but half consciously  familiar on this revolving stage  mythological Heroes and events of  remotest antiquity occupy the same  spatial and temporal PLS as modern  personages and contemporary happenings  all time occurs  simultaneously Tristram and Wellington  father Adam and Humpty Dumpty merge in a  single precept multiple meanings are  present in every line in interlocking  Illusions to keywords and phrases are  woven like Fugal themes into the pattern  of the work finigan wake is a prodigious  multifaceted monolith not only the  kashimar of a Dublin citizen but The  dreamlike Saga of guilt stained evolving  Humanity the vast scope and intricate  structure of finnan's weight give the  book A forbidding aspect of  impenetrability it appears to be a dense  and baffling jungle trackless and  overgrown with wanting perversities of  form and language clearly such a book is  not meant to be idly fingered it tasks  the imagination exacts discipline and  tenacity from those who would march with  it yet some of the difficulties  disappear as soon as the well-disposed  reader picks up a few Compass Clues and  gets his bearings then the enormous map  of finnan's wake begins slowly to unfold  characters and motifs emerge themes  become recognizable and Joy's vocabulary  Falls more and more familiarly on the  accustomed ear complete understanding is  not to be snatched at greedily in one  sitting or in 50 I might  add uh nevertheless the ultimate state  of the intelligent reader is certainly  not bewilderment rather it is an  admiration for the unifying in sight  economy of means and more than rabian  humor which have miraculously quickened  the stupendous mass of material one  acknowledges at last that James Joyce's  overwhelming micr macrocosm could not  have been fired to life in any sorcerer  furnace less black less heavy less murky  than this his Incredible Book he had to  smelt the modern dictionary back to  protein plasma and reenact the Genesis  and mutation of language in order to  deliver his message but the final wonder  is that such a message could be  delivered at  all every book has to be about something  I mean so what is this book about  well as far as anybody can tell um it  appears to be about uh someone named uh  well they have hundreds of names  actually but for economy sake someone  named Humphrey chimp  earwicker or abbreviated  hce and Humphrey earwicker runs a pub in  chapela which is a a suburb or a  district of  London and uh he has as it says an it  white  who is anivia  plabel and now these two people this  barkeep and his wife and their two  children Jerry and Kevin or Shem and  Shawn or and then they also have  hundreds of names because they occur on  hundreds and hundreds of levels every  brother struggle in history is enacted  by the two boys Jerry and Kevin they are  shim the Penman and to sha the other one  and they they dichotomize certain parts  of the process so uh here is in one  paragraph This is the cliff notes  version of what finigan wake is all  about if you Commit This to Memory you  will never be caught wanting at a New  York cocktail  party as the T unfolds we discover that  Humphrey chimp ear wicker is a citizen  of Dublin a stuttering Tavern keeper  with a bull like hump on the back of his  neck he imagines as a he emerges sorry  as a welldefined and sympathetic  character the sorely harrowed victim of  a Relentless fate which is stronger than  yet identical with himself Joyce refers  to him under various names such as Here  Comes everybody and haveth chers  everywhere indications of his  universality and his role as the great  progenitor the hero has wandered vastly  leaving families that is deposits of  civilization at every pause along the  way from Troy in Asia Minor he is  frequently called The Turk up through  the turbulent lands of the Goths the  Frank the Norsemen and overseas the  green Isles of Britain and the IR his  chief Germanic manifestations are voden  and Thor his chief Celtic mananan mlar  again he is St Patrick carrying the new  Faith again Strongbow leading the angl  Norman Conquest again Cromwell  conquering with a bloody hand most  specifically he is our Anglican Tavern  Keeper hce in the Dublin suburb  chapelizod so like ulses the ground zero  here is the utterly  mundane uh you know middle class  tormented Irish people embedded in the  detritus of the 20th century but there's  an effort to never lose the cosmic  perspective never lose the sense that we  are you know not individuals lost in  time but the front ends of Gene streams  that reach back to Africa  that we somehow have all these ancestors  and conflicts swarming and storming  within it it's a it's a very it's a  glorious psychedelic  heartful Irish view of what it is to be  um  uh embedded in the mystery of  existence well okay enough arm waving  now let's Cut the Cake here  River run past Eve and Adams from swerve  of shore to bend of bay brings us by a  commodious vicus of recirculation back  to Hoth castle and environs Sir Tristram  vord Mor for or the short sea had  passing core reared from North Amor on  this side the Scraggy ismus of Europe  minor to Welter fight his penisul War  nor had top Sawyers rocks by the stream  okone exaggerated

regano was to be seen ringum  on the  aqua the  fall  of a once wall straight old par is  retailed early in bed and later on life  do it down through all Christian  minstral SE the great fall of off wall  entailed at such short notice the fit  shoot of finegan Earth's solid man that  the Humpty Hill head of himself promptly  sends an uniring onewell to the West in  quest of his tumpy tum toes and their up  Turnpike toe and place is at The  Knockout in the park where oranges have  been laid to rust upon the green since  Devin's first loved  Livy so now granted that the first pages  are dense and it isn't all this dense  because even though the concept of  fractals lay  years in the future the effort here is  to tell the whole damn thing in the  first word to tell it again in the next  two words to tell it again in the next  three words and so on so here in these  first roughly three paragraphs a a huge  amount of information is being passed  along uh first of all uh we're given a  location if we're smart enough to know  it River run past even Adams from swerve  of shore to bend of bay brings us by a  commodious vicus of  recirculation back to Hoth castle and  environs well now if you know the  geography uh of Dublin you know that's  where you are because and notice howth  castle and environs Is HC e these  initials recur thousands of times in  this book always bringing you back to to  remind you that this has something to do  with Humphrey earwicker what this first  sentence says is River Run and it's the  river liy which we will meet in a  thousand reincarnations because Ana  Livia plabel is the personification of  the Goddess  River the river runs past even ad and  there is a church there on the shore  named Adam and evees in Dublin from  swerve of shore to bend of bay and then  this strange phrase brings us by a  commodious Vios of  recirculation this announces the great  architectonic plan of the Wake that it  is in fact going to be based on the  sociological ruminations of gam Batista  Vios lenia noova the  mode of  recirculation because as I'm sure you  all know VI's theory of the Fallen  Redemption of mankind was that there  were four  ages again remember gold silver iron and  Clay I think and so this idea of the  recirculation of the connectedness of  the cyclicity of the as he says the same  again again and again th again sin again  the same again and this is one of his  great great themes is the recurso  everything comes again nothing is  unowned love affair every dynastic  Intrigue every minor political disgrace  and a minor political disgrace figures  very prominently in this book Because as  the carrier of Adam's sin the the great  dilemma for Humphrey earwicker is that  he is running for a minor political post  Alderman but apparently one night uh  rather Juiced he relieved himself well  there are many versions and you hear  them all and they are all given in  dreams and in mock trials and an  accusatory fantasy he either innocently  took a leak in the park or he fondled  himself in some way in the presence of  Maggie and her sister in such a way that  his reputation is now at Great risk and  it all depends on the testimony of a cad  a soldier or perhaps three soldiers it's  never clear it's constantly shifting and  uh this question of uh you know  what happened when Maggie Cal with her  sister in Shaw at the magazine wall  haunts the book because on it turns the  question of whether hce is a a stalwart  pillar of the community are in fact a  backsliding masturbator and a monster  and so forth and so on as one always is  if one is trapped in a James Choice  novel uh then and this puzzling list in  the second paragraph is simply a list of  things which haven't happened yet sir  trist lover of music via Lord deor for  or the short sea had passing core not  yet reared from North Amor from the  coast of Britany on this side the  Scraggy ismus of Europe minor to  welterweight his penisul War now this is  this word penisul is typical Joyce  punning uh peninsul War obviously is  being launched from Britany penisul War  because sir tristam is the great  archetype of the lover and uh and so his  war is a  penisul uh okay so that's the first  thing that has not yet happened it's  telling you sir tristam has not yet come  to Ireland to put it simply  um nor has top Sawyers rocks by the  stream  okone exaggerated the cell to Lawrence  County gorgos while they went doubling  their mumber all the  time now this is further obscurity there  is a u there is a stream in  Georgia and top Sawyer is a reference to  Tom Sawyer because Tom Sawyer was Finn  Huck Finn's friend and Huck Finn is Finn  in America there is a huge amount of  Mark Twain that has been poured into  these books because of the Huckleberry  fin connection Finn in the New World  um and top Sawyer rocks is a reference  possibly to testicles and so forth and  so on every single word I mean you can  just take a word and go into this and  until you exhaust  yourself and then the next thing that  has not yet happened nor a voice from a  fire bellowed Mish Mish to tart art  Petri tart is Celtic for thou art  baptized so St Patrick has not yet  baptized in  Ireland not yet the venos soon  after and the venoso is a is a pun on  ven  and very soon had a kid scad butt ended  a bland old Isaac it's a reference to  the Isaac Esau Tale in the Bible it's  also a reference to uh Isaac buts who  was a figure in the politics of the  Irish  Rebellion  um not yet those all fairs in vany were  s cestors rock with to and Nathan Joe  that's at this point a very obscure  reference but there is a great incest  and Sister theme in finans wake and the  twin the  mistresses of uh Jonathan Swift become  carriers of a huge amount of energy in  here as do the mistresses of Thomas  Stern  uh because it's better to be swift than  Stern or something like  that uh and then the last of these  things which hadn't happened yet rot a  PEC of Paul's malt had gem or Shem  brewed by Ark light and Rory and the  rean bro was to be seen ring some on the  aqua face that seems pretty obscure to  me according to Joseph Campbell it's  simply a reference to uh the presence of  God moving over the waters uh in the  first lines of Genesis  ringum on the aqua face then the this  phrase the fall and the multisyllabic  word that word these are the vioni  Thunders and they announce the beginning  of each vioni and Age and and when the  Thunder speaks uh you know then that  there you're you're into a transition  then it actually launches in in the last  paragraph into a fairly straightforward  evocation of at least the  mythological uh finigan as you all  probably know there is an Irish Drinking  Ballad of great Antiquity called The  Ballad of Tim finigan or The Ballad of  Finnigan's Wake and it tells the the  story of uh Tim finigan who was a hod  carrier a brick layer's assistant and he  was given to uh hitting the poe rather  hard and he fell from his ladder it's  the Humpty Dumpty story he fell from his  ladder and he broke his back and his  friends W him in the grand Irish fashion  and at the height of the Wake they  became so carried away and intoxicated  that they upended a bucket of Guinness  over his head and he  revived and joined the  dance this is the resurrection I mean  Tim finan is very clearly for Joyce a a  Christ figure and here is then the first  evocation of Tim  finigan the fall then the vioni and  thunder of a once wall straight old par  which is just an old person is retailed  early in bed and later on life down  through all Christian minstral SE the  Great Fall of the off wall entailed at  such short notice the fsho of finigan  now this word p f t j s c h u t e fito  is  Norwegian uh I'm informed and refers  it's and it's Reef it refers to the the  act of falling and the act of falling  from a  hill finigan Earth's solid man that the  Humpty Hill head of himself promptly  sends an uniring onewell to the West in  quest of his tumpy tum toes and their  upturn Pike point and place is at The  Knockout in the park where oranges have  been laid to rust upon the green since  Devin's first loved Livy  this is fairly transparent if you're  Irish or a citizen of Dublin because  what it's talking about  is Dublin is imagined to be situated  basically in the belly of an enormous  giant person who is uh finegan finegan  lies like a giant reining figure along  the lify there husband and wife River  and mountain and and this is actually  then the focus has changed and now we're  talking about the  geography uh he was a solid man Earth's  solid man but then somehow he turned  into something where uh the Humpty Hill  head of himself promptly sends an  uniring onewell to the West in quest of  his tumpy tum toes and if you have a map  of Dublin laid out you can actually see  this enormous man in the landscape and  there are many  enormous men and women in the landscape  of this planet and Joyce Maps the Dublin  geography over all of them some of you  may know  istat the magical mountain in Mexico  istat means the sleeping woman in  toltech and many mountains are imagined  to be um sleeping people so here he  introduces this  theme and um this is one paragraph This  is the the invocation of finegan  uh as hod  carrier big Mr finegan of the stuttering  hand Freeman's M lived in the broadest  way IM marginable in his Rush lit too  far back for messages before before  Joshua and judges had given us numbers  or hel viticus Comm commuted  Deuteronomy one yeasty day he sternly  strs his tee in a tub for to wash the  future of his Fates but AR he swiftly  took it out again by the might of Moses  the very water was evaporated and all  the goodnesses had met their Exodus so  that ought to show you what a pin Juni  Choi was and during mighty odd years  this man of Hod cement and edifices hce  hod cement and edifices in topper storp  piled build Supra building upon the  banks of the livers by the so and soul  he FY Annie Ed the little creature with  her har and H took up your part in her  off while babulous Mir ahead with goodly  Trel and Gra ASP and ioral overalls  which he had particularly fancied like  Harum chck eger birth he would  calculate by multiple cobbles the  altitude and  multitude until he SE saw by neat light

from next to nothing and cating the  himels and all Hier architect tip of  floal with a burning bush a bob off its  bubble toop and with laen o ters clitter  up and Thomas a buckets cluttering  down now what the this paragraph says is  he was a great  Builder and I think if you think back  through your impression of hearing it  read you knew that you know these words  that are associated words like  um a wall worth of a sky scrape of most  eiel howth and  toly these are skyscraper words  Woolworth skyscrape in toly Hoth so  forth and so on and he can do this he  can build up a a pasti of surfaces of  Impressions now you might say why is  there no economy well there is no  economy because economy is an aesthetic  Criterion for shoe makers not for  artists and uh uh you know economy is  the curse of the bah house babblers from  Hell which Joyce was very concerned to  refute all of that if you have to place  this in a context it's in the context of  the most hallucinatory of the Baroque uh  you know this is Arkham Balo land this  is a a work that would have been welcome  at the rudolphine court in Prague it's a  work of magical complex it and um and uh  enfolded self  reference now we've just been through  these first four paragraphs now I'll  read you what uh Joseph Campbell has to  say on it by no means all of what he has  to say on it um the first four  paragraphs are the suspended tick of  time between a cycle just passed and one  about to begin they are in effect an  overture resonant with all the themes of  fegan's wake the dominant Motif is the  polylingual Thunderclap of paragraph  three baba baba Dar woman that one uh  which the voice of God makes audible  through the noise of Finnegan's fall  narrative movement begins with the life  fall and wake of hod carrier finigan  pages 4 to 7 the Wake scene Fades into  the landscape of Dublin and environment  we've just heard how he fell from the  ladder Now we move into a  description um of the of the wake and  there's a certain voice that appears at  certain times it's where there are a lot  of words ending in AO n continuation of  the celebration until the examination of  the

in this world  will you hear such a d again and he's  stiff but he's steady is prium all this  um all this um  dionan and sexual imagery is fully  explicit in some ways more realized as a  character or more lovable if that's the  word is an Olivia plabel I mean anivia  plabel is Molly Bloom on acid basically  I mean Molly  Bloom we don't lose her outlines we  understand Molly and because Molly  doesn't offer us that much of her own  mind she stands for the Eternal feminine  but only in the final Soliloquy in  ulyses do we really contact her an  Olivia it's her book it may in fact be  her dream and the whole thing is  permeated with her tensions and her  cares as it says grandpus is fallen down  meaning the great father God is at wake  grandp papus is fallen down but Grinny  spreads the board meaning an Olivia is  always there she's always there and in  in the Wake really you could almost say  that Molly Bloom's Soliloquy has been  expanded to 300 400 pages and the whole  thing is a meditation on the river the  river is the feminine and the first  image in the the book and the last image  are the image of the river the river  dissolves everything and carries it out  to see let me read this description of  an Olivia plabel and then we'll go back  to the synopsis how beautiful and how  true to wife of her when stringly  forbidden to steal our historic presence  from the past post  prooptical so as to will make us all  lordy bears and Lady mides of a pretty  nice kettle of fruit she is living in  our midst of Deb and laughing through  all plor for us her birth is  uncontrollable with a napperon for her  mask and her saos kicking Aras so s so  Sly if you ask me and I sack you how how  Greeks may rise and tryers fall she is  mercenary through the length of the land  lies under liquidation flute and there's  n a Harbo nor an Eye Brush on this  globous place of Herr what our vter  shall loan a Vesta and hire some Pete  and sarch the shores her cockles to heat  and she'll do all a tarf woman can to  Puff the business on puff to Puff the  blaz on puff puff and even if Humphrey  shall fall frumpty times as awkward  again in the Beards Busom of all our  grand  remonstrances there'll be eggs for The  Breakers come to mourn him sunny side up  with care so true it is that there's  where's a turnover the Tay is wet too  and when you think you catch sight of a  hind make sure you're cocked by a  hin well Nora felt that Jimmy would have  been much better as a  singer she so stated that she had Great  Hopes for his voice and she was a very  practical woman Nora Barnacle there  wasn't a literary bone in her body I  think uh I think that's what Joyce loved  about her was that she was the real  thing uh and all these women Molly and  Olivia uh uh they all are  Nora Joyce for sure he  um died shortly after it was published  although it had been known in manuscript  for over 10 years to the Literati of his  Circle um it was called work in  progress and um people didn't even know  if he was serious or not uh and it was  very hard to find a publisher it was a  typographical nightmare Joyce was going  blind and so you know trying to keep  track of of of the spelling and there's  hardly a standard spelling in there  there's hardly a word that is uh not  somehow fiddled with and uh and changed  around if you pay attention to what  you're calling life as it is you will  discover that it's not a simple thing at  all that it's an Inc that it's like this  I mean I used to say  when you're vacuuming your apartment  Rome Falls nine times an hour and your  job is to notice and you always do  notice but you never tell yourself that  you're noticing so it in the course of a  day you know I I  live and you live to some degree the  entirity of of global  civilization I mean Rome fall  algebra is discovered the Turks are  beating at the gates of Vienna and it  isn't even 11: a.m. yet you know uh so  there is this sense of uh the the  co-presence of History the we are  imprisoned inside the linear assumption  that I'm a person in a place in a time  I'm alive most people aren't but but in  fact when you deconstruct all that  that's just  that is fiction and the truth is more  this onrushing magma of literary  Association and you know in Ulisses you  get an enormous amount of half-baked  science Leopold Bloom is always looking  at things and explaining to himself how  they work using very crack potted  Notions of hydraulics and electricity  and this sort of thing  I think  uh you know people say the Psychedelic  experience is hard to remember dreams  are hard to remember but harder to  remember than either of those is simply  ordinary experience you know you lie in  the bath and you close your eyes for 30  seconds and Empires fall dynastic  families unfold themselves power changes  hands princes are beheaded a pulp  disgrace so for that was for you and  uh and then somebody drops something and  you wake up and 15 seconds have passed  that's the reality of life but we  suppress this chaotic irrational side  The Genius of joy and to some degree  although in a more controlled form PR  and then there were other practitioners  faler certainly was what they called  stream of Consciousness but what it was  was it was an ability to listen to the  associating mind without trimming  pruning judging denying it one of the  great puzzles to me is the great  antagonism between Yung and Joyce  because you would have thought that they  would have been comrades in  arms uh but uh uh  Joyce loathed psychoanalysis he didn't  he thought that to use all this material  to elucidate imagined pathologies was a  very uncreative use of it and that it  should all be fabricated in uh into  literature it it's very hard to  surpass uh you know Thomas pinin William  Gadis these people they everybody  genuflects to Joyce but very few people  plow in the way he did I mean Thomas  Pinchin is considered a difficult  hallucinatory uh writer and there isn't  20 pages in in gravity's Rainbow as  obscure as a randomly chosen page here  uh I I can understand the impulse to uh  to want to get the universe into a book  because it hints at something that we've  talked about in some of these circles or  whatever they are which is that that  um the character of  life is like a work of  literature we are told that you're  supposed to fit your experience into the  model which science gives you which is  probabilistic  statistical  predictable and yet it's the felt datum  of experience is much more literary than  that I mean we fall in love we make and  lose fortunes we are we inherit houses  in Scotland we lose everything we get  terrible diseases we're cured of them or  we die of them but it all has this  strong and Dr aspect to it which physics  is not supposed to have but which  literature always has and I think that I  don't know if it's true but I think what  Joyce believed and what I'm willing to  entertain at some depth is the idea that  salvation is somehow an act of  encompassing  comprehension that salvation is an  actual Act of of  apprehension of understanding and that  this act of apprehension involves  everything this is why the U the  alchemic before James Joyce and this  kind of literature the only place where  you got these kinds of constructs was in  alchemy and Magic the idea that you  know through an act of Magic the  Universe could be condensed to yield a  fractal  microcosm of itself well then what Joyce  is saying is that the novel which was  unknown in the alchemical era the novel  comes later I mean arguably but the real  zest for the novel comes in the 19th  century that the that the novel is the  uh alchemical retort into which these  these theories of uh of how things work  can be cast I think the great modern  exponent of this although now dead and  certainly one who owed an enormous debt  to Joyce was Vladimir  Nabokov especially in Ada Ada is is his  paying of praise to finnan's wake  basically and and the idea tacked in  there is uh the idea of  causality and ordinary  cry see that what all these people are  saying I think and and what the  Psychedelic experience argues for as  well is that we are somehow prisoners of  language and that  somehow you know if we're prisoners of  language then the key which will set us  loose is somehow also made of language  what else could fit the lock so somehow  an act of  poetic Leisure  derain is  necessary and and joy in Fan's wake I  mean he didn't live to argue the case or  to work it out he died shortly after but  this comes about as close as anybody  ever came to actually pushing the entire  contents of the universe down into about  14 cubic  Ines Joyce and PR had one  meeting and  supposedly Joyce said to PR  uh I'm too young for you to teach me  anything are you all familiar with the  remembrance of things past well it could  hardly be a more different work of  literature I mean it is stately and  cinematic and you always know where you  are and the characters you defined it's  an old style novel but there are places  in it where he just takes flight and uh  prefigures the the kind of writing that  fauler and Joyce were able to do as far  as psychedelic  influences I don't I don't know that  there are argu  any uh Joyce lived in triest for a while  and taught English he may have been as a  as a habitu of Paris he may have been  familiar with hashish he probably had  some familiarity with  absin uh but I doubt that it was a  lifestyle for him  um I think that the whole of the 20th  century is informed Med by this  hyperdimensional understanding and that  you know um Yung tapping into it in in  the 20s the Dos in 1919 in Zurich the  surrealist even earlier the a dupa  physique  lonar all of these people it it's what  it's about the 20th century is this uh  well the mclin's phrase comes to mind  the Gutenberg Galaxy the spectrum of  effects created by print you know the  classes the conceits the industries the  products the attitudes the garments all  of the things created uh by print and we  are living in a um in a terminal  civilization I mean I don't want to say  dying because civilizations aren't  animals uh but we are living in an age  of great self summation when we what we  look back at is basically since um the  fall of Rome there has been an  unbroken working out of certain themes  scholasticism NE the Aristotelian and  platonic  corpuses Christianity all is presented  as a somehow rival to science is in fact  paves the way for science there would  have been no science had there not been  William aakam who was a a 14th Century  nominalist  theologian uh really Western  Civilization has had a thousand years to  work its magic and  now there is a summation underway and I  don't certainly presume uh at least not  this evening to judge it how how do you  how do you place a value on an entire  civilization but uh  uh in the same way that when a person  dies their entire life passes before  them in review when a civilization dies  it it hypn gically Cycles the detrus of  centuries and centuries of struggle to  understand and uh someone like Joyce I  think just brings that to an  excruciating uh climax because it's all  there you know the the the it's all  there from the smile that tugs at the  lips of the woman in the arnoldi wedding  to quantum physics to what molier said  to his niece in the 15th letter and so  forth and so on and uh and the and the  task is to hold it in your mind I think  it was James uh I think it was um  William James who said if we don't read  the books with which we carefully line  our Apartments then we're no better than  our dogs and cats  and uh you know too too often this is  lost sight of and the point of it it's  not simply that we are athes literatur  and that here in the Twilight of the  Gods we should sit around reading James  Joyce that isn't the point the point is  that this is the distillation of our  experience of what it is to be human and  it's out of these kinds of of distilling  processes that we can launch some kind  of  new uh new  dispensation for the human Enterprise  because we we have played it we have  played it out it's a it's uh it's now a  set piece all of it I mean when I listen  to rock and roll now I it's as in it's  interesting to me but it has the  completness of U Poli  you know it's a done deal somehow and  we're Looking Backward and we're  anticipating and the purpose of  literature I think is is to illuminate  the past and to give a certain guidance  as we move into the future and and this  book by being at first so opaque and so  challenging to aesthetic cannons and and  social values eventually emerges as a  very  preent insight into our uh our our  circumstance The Ballad of Finnegan's  wake has hundreds of verses and uh in an  Irish Pub can keep people going all  night uh all night long it's a  celebration of complexity and of uh the  human journey and of and Joyce doesn't  judge I mean you know it says somewhere  in finigan Wake here in my kanaine which  is the red light district of dumblin  here in moain we flop on the seami side  but up the yent prospector you sprout  all your worth and woof your wings so if  you want to be Phoenix come and be  parked that's that passage about death  here in Maine we flop on the seami side  but up the Y you sprout all your worth  and woof your wings it was a very  optimistic uh uh transformative sort of  vision somehow complexity is what is the  ocean we have to learn to surf that's  the river yes that's the river and and  that's the Psychedelic side of it I mean  imagine that you can get 63,000  different words in here tell a story and  have all the article common article and  modifiers operating normally anyway um  it it's a it's uh and then it's very  optimistic I mean Molly Bloom's speech  uh is you know probably the single most  optimistic outpouring in all of 20th  century  literature not that there was much  competition but  huh yes yes they final affirmation yes  Sam Becket Nobel Prize winner genius in  his own right but secretary to James  Joyce for many many years and  passionately in love with Joyce's  tragically schizophrenic daughter one of  the you know you want an unhappy story  the story of of Sam you'll find out why  Sam Becket is not exactly laughing all  the time in his word uh a very very  complex relationship to Joyce's  schizophrenic child Joyce's family life  was not very happy I think he had a  wonderfully sensuous life with  Nora but I don't know what it would be  like to be the guy who wrote this book  and live with a woman who thought you  would be better off as a saloon  singer uh not exactly a saloon singer I  mean he did but but still  hey it's denit Friedman if you watch  till this far then I want to say thank  you and I hope you got inspired and have  a
